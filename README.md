Made a website for a musical artist "Tyler the creator", made the main page, added the name on the left which refreshes the page when clicked,
added , hero page and three section page.
I tried adding pictures, took help from copilot but it crashed my website, so i had to go with colors.
Did the hamburger, and also added footers on all the links.
Used Copilot for some optimization.
